SimplAjax is a simple JavaScript library to make AJAX calls.

Installation
------------
Download SimplAjax, read the license and put `simplajax.js` in the root directory of your web server. Include it in your HTML as follows:

    <script src='/simpajax.js'></script>

Usage
-----
You need to create a `SimplAjax` object which you can call methods on. The currently accepted methods are `start()` and `stop()`. Note that a `SimplAjax` object's options are immutable. You can initialize it like this:

    var simplajax = new SimplAjax(options);

Where options is an object that has at least a `URL` attribute. Other possible attributes are:

 - `method` - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` or `HEAD`
 - `requestHeaders` - an object containing custom request headers
 - `username` - a username for basic HTTP auth
 - `password` - a password for basic HTTP auth
 - `body` - the body for a `POST` or `PUT` request
 - `success` - a callback function which is called on success
 - `error` - a callback function which is called on failure

The `success` and `error` functions must be of the following signature:

    function(data, statuscode, responseheaders)

Example
-------
This is an example of a `GET` request:

    var getExample = new SimplAjax({
      URL: '/index.html',
      success: function(data, statuscode, responseHeaders) {
        alert(data);
        alert(statuscode);
        alert(responseHeaders);
      },
      error: function(data, statuscode, responseHeaders) {
        alert(statuscode);
      }
    });
